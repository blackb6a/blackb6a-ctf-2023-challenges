I have made an one-time pad encryption using quantum mechanics!  
Since it's truly random there is no way you can crack it!  
Unless you could perform some quantum entanglement on the qubits...  

P.S. Being a quantum challenge, a powerful computer is required (24GB RAM)  
to encrypt the flag file! However, whether you could encrypt the flag file  
actually doesn't affect whether you could solve the challenge.
