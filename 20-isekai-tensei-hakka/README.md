## Description

### 不死傳說

As we all know, CTFs are not good for our health. After burning the midnight oil for three days on the DeathCoin CTF, you die. You then reincarnate into a sword and magic world with a special skill called "Za Warudo no Sosukodo," because you complained that DeathCoin CTF did not release the source code of a web challenge before you died. Can you become the strongest Yuusha beyond the world?

Remarks: 
- The world will be reborn every 30 minutes.
- The Yggdrasill did not grow any Pear.
- The "goddess" (♂) only granted you the source code with Isekai language (no, it is called Chinese) but not the Dockerfile. Maybe you should also complain that the CTF did not release the Dockerfile before you died again.
