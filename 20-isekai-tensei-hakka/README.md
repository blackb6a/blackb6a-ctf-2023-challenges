Isekai Tensei Hakka
===

## Description

As we all know, CTF is not good for health. After burning the midnight oil for DeathCoin CTF for three days, you die. You reincarnate to a sword and magic world with a special skill "Za Warudo no Sosukodo" (nothing related to time stopping or Sudoku), because you complained that DeathCoin CTF did not release the source code of a web challenge before you die. Can you become the strongest Yuusha beyond the world? 

Flag 1: XSS attack the Maou
Flag 2: Discover the secret of the world

Remark: The world will be reborn per 30 minutes. The godness (â™‚) only grant you the source code with Isekai language (no, it is called Chinese) but not the Dockerfile :-(... Good Luck
